# Settings Page - Product Notification System

## Overview
I've successfully created a comprehensive Settings page that allows users to configure product notifications. The system includes:

## Features

### 1. Price Alerts
- **Purpose**: Notify users when products in their wishlist drop to a target price
- **Example**: "I want notification when product A in wishlist drops to $500"
- **Features**:
  - Select any product from wishlist
  - Set target price (must be lower than current price)
  - Edit target price for existing alerts
  - Enable/disable individual alerts
  - Automatic validation and error handling

### 2. Stock Alerts  
- **Purpose**: Notify users when products in their cart are back in stock
- **Example**: "I want notification when this product in my cart is available again"
- **Features**:
  - Select any product from cart
  - Automatic stock monitoring
  - Enable/disable individual alerts
  - Visual status indicators

### 3. General Notification Settings
- **Browser Notifications**: Request and manage browser notification permissions
- **Email Notifications**: Toggle email notifications on/off
- **Price Alerts**: Global toggle for all price alerts
- **Stock Alerts**: Global toggle for all stock alerts  
- **Promotional Emails**: Opt-in for marketing emails

## Technical Implementation

### Data Persistence
- All settings saved to localStorage per user
- Automatic save when any setting changes
- Data tied to user ID for multi-user support

### Notification Service
- Background monitoring service (`notificationService.ts`)
- Simulates price checking and stock updates
- Browser notification API integration
- Permission handling and fallbacks

### User Interface
- Clean, responsive design
- Visual toggle switches
- Inline editing for price alerts
- Progress indicators and validation
- Toast notifications for user feedback

## File Structure
```
src/pages/Settings.tsx          # Main settings page component
src/services/notificationService.ts  # Background monitoring service  
src/App.tsx                     # Added route and navigation link
```

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Backend Integration**: Connect to real pricing and inventory APIs
2. **Email Service**: Integrate with email service (SendGrid, etc.)
3. **Push Notifications**: Add mobile push notifications
4. **Advanced Scheduling**: Configurable check intervals
5. **Notification History**: Track and display past notifications
6. **Bulk Operations**: Manage multiple alerts at once

The system is now ready for testing and can be extended with additional notification types and delivery methods as needed.
